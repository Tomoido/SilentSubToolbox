SilentSubstitutionToolbox
=======================

MATLAB toolbox to compute estimates of human photoreceptor spectral
sensitivities, compute silent substitution spectral modulations for a variety of
devices (including standard monitors and devices with many narrowband
primaries), and to estimate the normal variation of photoreceptor spectral
sensitivities and how much contrast splatter a given modulation can be expected
to produce on nominally silenced photoreceptors.
