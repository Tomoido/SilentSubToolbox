# SilentSubstitutionToolbox

### 1. Description
MATLAB toolbox to compute estimates of human photoreceptor spectral sensitivities, compute silent substitution spectral modulations for a variety of devices (including standard monitors and devices with many narrowband primaries), and to estimate the normal variation of photoreceptor spectral sensitivities and how much contrast splatter a given modulation can be expected to produce on nominally silenced photoreceptors.

### 2. License
This software is licensed under the license specified in LICENSE.md (MIT License). The code may be used freely. Using it to compute robust modulations by silencing multiple photoreceptor classes is covered by a U.S. Patent Application (United States Patent Application 20160073922) and is subject to licensing.


### 3. Developers
Developed by Manuel Spitschan (Lead Developer; Stanford University, 2016-now, University of Pennsylvania, 2012-2016); Geoffrey K. Aguirre (University of Pennsylvania), David H. Brainard (University of Pennsylvania).
